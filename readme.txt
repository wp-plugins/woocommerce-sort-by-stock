Sort your WooCommerce products by the stock amount on the WooCommerce product dashboard page.

== Description ==

'WooCommerce Sot By Stock' is a relatively simple plugin. It does one thing and one thing only: allows you to sort by stock amount in WooCommerce.

Upon activation of this plugin, your WooCommerce product dashboard page will allow you to sort product by the amount of stock remaining. Simply click on the `Stock` admin column.

If sorting in ascending order, out of stock items will be shown first, followed by in stock but inventory not managed (no stock amount number), and finally showing in stock items which have a stock amount number, starting with 1 and increasing.

If sorting in descending order, will provide the opposite, starting with items with the largest amount of stock, moving down to out of stock.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the `wc-sort-by-stock` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the `Plugins` menu in WordPress
3. There are no options. Just go to the Products dashboard page, click the `Stock` column header, and you will be able to sort by the amount of stock

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Do I need to change any settings when installing this plugin? =

No. Once you activate the plugin, you'll be able to sort by stock amount. No options or setting changes are required.

= Does this change the ordering of products on the frontend? =

No. This plugin only allows you to sort by stock amount on the dashboard (backend) of your site. This will not affect your frontend in any way.
